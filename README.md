# 🌗 React Theme Toggle App

A simple React frontend app that allows users to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode using a toggle button. Built with React functional components and the `useState` hook to manage theme state.

## 🎯 Features

- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Uses React's `useState` for theme state management
- Applies dynamic styling based on current theme
- Fully frontend-only (no backend required)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (Functional Components)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
- React Hooks: `useState`


## ⚙️ How It Works

- `useState` is used to store the current theme (`light` or `dark`)
- A button toggles the theme by updating the state
- CSS classes or inline styles dynamically change based on the theme state
